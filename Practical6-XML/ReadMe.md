## Project 6 - XML (eXtensible Markup Language)

Code which defines and utilises functions for:
* Opening XML files.
* Validating XML files against both DTD and XSD schemas.
* Writing new data to XML files.
* Transforming XML into other formats. 

XML is a data format based around text; as such, it is both human and machine readable.  
The text is "marked up" using angle brackets (<>) which define what the text relates to.  
XML must comply to certain syntactical standards.  
There are various XML schemas which dictate constraints for formatting of XML documents against which XML files can be validated.      
 
Two of the most popular schemas are:
* [Document Type Defintion (DTD)](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_dtd_intro.asp)
* 
* XML schema definition (XSD)  

XML may also be converted into other formats (e.g. HTML) using XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language).
