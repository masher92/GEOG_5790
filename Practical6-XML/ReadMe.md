<ins>Background information:</ins>  
XML is a data format based around text; as such, it is both human and machine readable.  
The text is "marked up" using angle brackets (<>) which define what the text relates to.  
XML must comply to certain syntactical standards.  
There are various XML schemas which dictate constraints for formatting of XML documents. XML can be validated against these schema for validity.  
 
Two of the most popular schemas are:
* Document Type Defintion (DTD)
* XML schema definition (XSD)  

XML may also be converted into other formats (e.g. HTML) using XSL (eXtensible Stylesheet Language).
