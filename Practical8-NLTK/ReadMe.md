## Project 8 - NLTK - Natural Language Toolkit

This project conducts natural language processing of the poem "The Wasteland" by T.S.Elliot. 
The goal is to create a map using Google Geocoding API showing the whereabouts of locations mentioned in the poem.  

Current state:
* Poem tokenized into individual words.  
* Proper nouns identified through [part-of-speech tagging)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging).  
* Proper nouns filtered further to remove incorrect entries.  
* Geocoding of proper nouns not conducted - can't access Google Geocoding API without supplying bank details.
