## Project 8 - NLTK - Natural Language Toolkit

Natural language processing of the poem "The Wasteland" by T.S.Elliot.  
Extracts proper nouns from the poem. 
Creates a map using Google Geocoding API showing the whereabouts of locations mentioned in the poem.  

Current state:
* Poem parsed and split into tokens.
* Various statistics run on the tokens to analyse words appearing in the poem.
* Part of speech tagging performed allowing proper nouns to be extracted
* Many of these proper nouns are not actualy proper nouns - due to the capitilisation which appears in the poem e.g. whole words capitalised or words capitalised on new lines.
* Geocoding of proper nouns not conducted - can't acces Google Geocoding API without supplying bank details.
