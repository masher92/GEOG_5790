## Project 9 - Cellular automata

Cellular Automata model of the spread of a forest fire.


Current state:
Animation of the fire spreading is working
but the printing of the fire to the console suggests something not working correctly, e.g. repetition of "ends at iteration 0" statement.

Additionally, spreading of fire is not even
Still problem where it is spreading downwards faster than upwards (as within one iteraiton cells below get set on fire before they are reached)
