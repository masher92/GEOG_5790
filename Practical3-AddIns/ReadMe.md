## Project 3 - AddIns

Convert code we have so far so that it runs as an addin.

An add-in is a customization, such as a collection of tools on a toolbar, that plugs into an ArcGIS Desktop application (that is, ArcMap, ArcCatalog, ArcGlobe, and ArcScene) to provide supplemental functionality for accomplishing custom tasks.


AddIn project -
Addin toolbar - A toolbar is a container for buttons, tools, combo boxes, tool palettes, and menus. Toolbars can be floating or docked in desktop applications, 
just like any system toolbar provided by Esri. 
Toolbars can also be activated so they show up when a desktop application is started.

AddinButton-
A button is the simplest form of customization that can be used to execute some business logic when clicked.


Note:
When making changes to addIN
Note that each time you change the addin code, you'll need to rebuild the addin.esriaddin and run the install addin wizard. 
You'll also need to restart ArcMap.
