## Project 5 - SQLite

SQL is a relational database language. SQLite is a mean of interaction with databases in Python.
In this project the SQLite3 module is used. In order to interact with databases it requires creation of a connection object that represents the database. In order to execute SQL statements, a cursor object (which traverses the rows in the database) is needed. 

This project contains:
* Createdb.py - A script to write an SQLite database.
* Readdb.py - A script to read an SQLite database.

To Do;
Readdb.py - end needs improving documentation.
